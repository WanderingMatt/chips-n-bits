Last year was a fundamental gaming shift for me. Instead of just picking up games, playing them for a few hours and letting them fall by the wayside, I decided it was time for a change. I began an effort to go through and beat the games. I would stick with them until the end. This lead to a pretty enjoyable year and lead to my falling madly in love with video games. 

You see I was tired of blowing money on things. So I opted to stop purchasing games and instead to play games I owned (with a few exceptions).

Over the course of the year I beat the following:

- Assassin's Creed: Revelations
- Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
- Alan Wake
- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
- Call of Duty 4
- Shadow Complex
- Bastion
- Braid
- Limbo
- Dead Space 2
- Red Dead Redemption
- Lara Croft: Guardian of Light
- Portal 2
- Infamous
- Infamous 2
- Darksiders
- Deus Ex: Human Revolution
- Metroid: Other M
- Uncharted 3
- Batman Arkham City
- Gears of War 3
- L.A. Noire
- God of War

That's a lot of games, and a lot of time that I realy enjoyed. This year the focus is a bit different. Instead of driving through titles through completion I've decided to really spend time with a bunch of high quality titles. This will allow me to try out different experiences that the designers implemented. So far, I've been getting 100% completion on Arkham City which has proven challenging but has also lead to some great discoveries (like the Killer Croc cameo) which I've never run into. 

So this year is about less. Here are the titles on my plate, and I intend to play them for a lot longer period of time. 

- Arkham City
- Skyrim
- Mass Effect 3
- Bioshock Infinite
- Darksiders 2
- Final Fantasy XIII-2
- Grand Theft Auto IV
- Dragon Age

There are other games that I'm sure I'll throw in. Finishing up the God of War series and the Modern Warfare games, for example, are on the list. I also intend to play through Mass Effect 1 - 3 all the way through. I've never played it's DLC. These are all incredible marathons. 

What are your gaming plans for the year?
