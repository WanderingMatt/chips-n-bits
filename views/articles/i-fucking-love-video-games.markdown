It's not very difficult to trick a 5 year old to follow your will.

In the mid 90s I enslaved my little brother to bring me food and beverages. Now, before you think to yourself "what a terrible monster", please know that I lied to him afterwards.

There. Now think "what a terrible monster."

The reason I enslaved my little brother was because I developed a barter system. "Get me a Coke," I would say, "and I'll let you play."

Letting him play was a fabrication. I created the illusion that the second, not-plugged-in controller was in fact bringing the characters onscreen to life. It was me driving the whole time.

This exchange, repeated numerous times over the course of several years, would cause bitterness between him and I. The master/slave relationship doesn't go over well when the slave ascends to enlightenment.

It would then become one of life's great ironies that my little brother came to me from Niagara Falls, NY in a rough patch. It's a family tradition in our early 20s to break down and build-up, break and build-up again. A Meyers' tradition in the vein of a South American government.

So to Seattle he came to stay with us for a bit. It wasn't always easy. Sometimes he's incredibly lazy. I left for Seattle when he was 12 years old. We didn't have a chance to get to know one another after his station as my personal butler.

We've always shared one thing in common. If, by the contents of this blog you guess "homoerotic feelings for Canadians", you would be correct. We also really love video games.

So we sat down and started co-op Gears of War 2. Then he got a job. Then he started feeling better. Then we'd continue to play Gears of War 2, laughing and dying. The anxiety of running through particularly tough situations turned to blame; anger turned to great triumph.

We'd continue to meet every week to just play through whatever video game we could play together. Like "Tuesday's with Morrie" but with chainsaws on the gun I assume Morrie used. We grew closer and formed a stronger bond. Video games gave us something to do while we were actually just catching up with each other. This happened most every week for a year, until I packed up and moved to San Francisco.

Last week, my brother died of Stage 4 lung cancer.

No, I'm kidding. He's alive and doesn't have cancer. We play video games together almost every week. Video games are the weekly check in. Instead of inconveniencing each other with a phone call where everyone half-focuses, we now get on Skype and Starcraft II. Our half-focus turns into a destroyed base or two, but we know what's going on with one another in the real world.

Video games became our common language and the gateway to a much broader and interesting understanding of each other.

This is one of the many reasons I love video games.

A lot. I love them so much that the majority of my free time is dedicated to playing them. I love them so much that I designed this blog so that I could have a place to talk about them. I love them so much that I subject myself to a weekly Skype call with that asshole Kenny to talk about them in greater detail.

Seriously, I cant believe it has taken this long. Video games have been an essential part of my life for as long as I can remember. We've grown up together. I still remember unwrapping my NES. Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt were included. It was unbelievable. You could jump across 2D blocks and onto mushrooms. Now, I'm playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. You can jump across ultra-realistic, 3D, Renaissance-era, Roman rooftops and onto unsuspecting guards. Incognito. While flinging throwing knives. Ending world hunger in the process.

Video games are a part of me. Underneath my skin, well, you'd find Canadian bacon. Underneath that bacon though, you'd find video games. They keep my brain flexed and my fingers loose. They are my entertainment and my stress reliever. Most importantly, they have forged friendships and informed my passion for design.

Enter Bits! A place where I'll venture to document all of the things I feel about video games. I have also unlocked a secret weapon and brought it with me. Below me (literally), is a man who loves video games as much as I do.
