For many, it means they have Angry Birds on their iPhone.For others, that game is a gateway. The experience opens up whole new worlds, with new games to try, and they find themselves video game aficionados. Geeks. Gamers.Within this group there are those whose game grows up with them. It follows them through loss, heartbreak, joy, laughter, health, sickness and death. A great game is like a great song and the experience of living is marked by the time you kept playing it over and over. Then, at another point in your timeline, the sequel arrives and a new experience arises.These are the stories of how one game series keeps coming in and out of my life.## The 80sMike owned Final Fantasy I. You probably have a Mike in your life. The kid you grew up with that was better than you at video games. You know the one. You bought a game like Battletoads and, after drenching your controller in palm sweat for 3 hours, you were incredibly angry and frustrated. Then, Mike Girard comes over and the next thing you know you're at the final boss battle of the game. You hated Mike for it, but he was also your buddy. By the end of its lifetime, my household had acquired 50 NES games. We counted them. From Bubble Bobble to Double Dragon, all the Marios, all the Zeldas, we had them. The one game we would never own, however, was Final Fantasy.I remember vividly staring at the carpet, looking at the game cartridge at Mike's house. It was the standard Nintendo cartridge, grey with ridges (like Ruffles chips). It has an illustration that looks more appropriate for a Tolkien book then what the heavily eastern themes of the series would make it.I asked Mike Girard questions about the game. He told me about the Rat Tail which would transform your heroes into near superheroes. He told me about Chaos, the last guy, which I mistakenly mispronounced Cha-hos. He showed me his Red Mage with the fancy hat and he went into the game world and battled imps. I was fascinated. I kept asking more and more questions about the mechanics and what he was doing. I was just sitting there watching, around 7 years old. Finally, I picked up the controller, thrilled, and tried on my own. 20 minutes later I quit in sweaty-palm frustration. It was too damn hard and I never finished it.Mike beat it several times.## Spring 2010Final Fantasy XIII breaks my heart. It is Spring of 2010 and I have recently moved to San Francisco. I am doing remote work and am home a lot. It is a frustrating time for me and XIII doesn't help. Getting a Final Fantasy on a next generation console like the PS3 is a dream come true. Square-Enix has the platform to create beautiful, high-definition artwork and tell brilliant intricate tales. In most modern RPGs, like the Mass Effect series, character arcs are complex, sad, interesting and beautiful. Imagine how this could translate to the game series that has mastered making great characters?You do know the character arc, right? It's repeated over and over in our stories and histories; the same basic patterns. In Final Fantasy it's simple. 1. Man is living a normal life. 2. Man comes into trouble. 3. Trouble expands to global disaster. 4. Man overcomes trouble and, in the process, learns what it means to be a decent human being and to work together.In the best written games, not just in Final Fantasy, it's implied in the story and the action. You see characters change in their approach, they don't announce they've changed.In Final Fantasy XIII, when an event occurs and the reactions take place, it's like watching a vicious dialogue troll eat everything you like about someone and spit it back at you. The characters droll on and on about how they're changing and what they want to be. They explicitly state, time and time again, that they need to be the "hero" or that "they have to save [insert person]". They are explaining their feelings and what you're supposed to do next constantly.Then *that* song plays. That insipid song. It all starts at once: The strings. The piano. The girls voice singing the melody with lyrics that are unclear. It's cheesy, it's repetitive and it keeps playing over and over WHILE the characters were making expository claims about themselves and the plot. It becomes a Pavlovian reaction. Every time the piano starts, my eyes roll into the back of my head and I gag. "I need to be a Hero." My senses overload with anger. This is my favorite game series and I am watching it destroy itself.Then there are the reminders of the series brilliance, scattered throughout the game. I can even hear them in the main theme that keeps playing over and over, but it's only at the end.Listen from 1:05 onward.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDfqCNgeHTU][http://soundcloud.com/shinageha/serahs-theme]I begin to wonder if I am suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. Were all Final Fantasies this bad? No. I remember the dialogue in X being cheesy but never all-consuming. Plus, Final Fantasy IX was a wonderful game with no such dialogue. Final Fantasy XIII's dialogue and music is a Cthulu, a destroyer.I've been through every emotion with Final Fantasy;  from anger to frustration, joy to sadness. There is one thing I've never been and that's bored. Final Fantasy XIII bored me.I will never forgive it for that. ## September 1997My parents are in Europe for two weeks and I've just started high school. My aunt is watching us and she isn't doing a great job. I am not allowed to play video games on school nights, but this was a taste of freedom my 14-year-old self could not ignore. I use my birthday money to buy a Playstation and Final Fantasy VII. Many people think Final Fantasy VII is the greatest Final Fantasy ever made, but not me. For a lot of people, it was the one that turned them onto the series. It was strange, interesting and visually stunning. I'm not one of them, but I loved it.I plug the Playstation into my parent's large screen television. It is a big no-no to plug-in a video game system because the TV is one of those old 47" monstrosities the size of a 1950s mainframe computer. Supposedly the bright colors of video games make a lasting impact on the TV's picture. I am 14 and a shithead; however, and I want to play this new game from my favorite series on a big ass television. So here I am, actively disobeying my parents decrees:1. Thou shalt not plug thine system into mine television.2. Thou shalt not play thine video games on the day of schoolingI broke a third commandment. The details are fuzzier, but I'm certain I wasn't supposed to buy this Playstation. Half of all proceeds received from my birthday went into a savings account. It was parent-law. The unbreakable laws. This tactic was employed to teach me the value of saving. With my parents away, I spent all my birthday money on the Playstation and Final Fantasy.I suffered for it later with the lowest GPA I ever received. That is, until Final Fantasy X.## 1994Final Fantasy VI (or III as it was known back in 1994) is one of the finest games I've ever played. It would take 16 years before I fell in love with video game characters like I did these[^1]. A rag tag group of rebels fight to change the world, are unable to stop its destruction, but then rally together to overcome it's source.I still remember Gogo, and Umaro. I still remember the sand submersion of Figaro. When the world burned, destroyed by a madman, I was in shock. I remember going to Blockbuster Video each week to see if it had been rented. Every week I call and ask, “Do you have Final Fantasy III in?” One weekend I finally got a yes and my dad drove me to pick it up.Besides being my favorite in the series, Final Fantasy VI contains one of the most notable events in gaming. The game was fast-paced and had multiple running story threads and character arcs. It was a complex multi-character narrative layered with symbolism and anti-industrial pro-environmental intrigue. It would jump from a large battle to a beautiful moment of character development in an instant.In particular, there was one scene that transcended 16 bits and became art. I was 11and my eyes were wide open. It's one of the finest moments in gaming, the opera scene:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgZXiHfNt0M## Spring 2001Every time I purchase a Final Fantasy, I purchase a strategy guide. Every time I play a Final Fantasy, I want to accomplish everything the game has to offer. With each game, came its purchased compendium and, with each compendium, a process would begin. First, start the game and play to a certain point. Second, read the guide. Particularly the non-walkthrough portions where they discuss leveling up your character or sidequests. Finally, restart the game from the beginning trying to maintain perfection through the entire playthrough. Many people have questioned this style of play. If you're playing a game then a piece of that is the interaction and discovery. With the guide you forfeit that surprise.Final Fantasies are never about discovery. It's about taking a group of characters to the end. It's a shared experience between me and the bits, getting to know each other. There's a bit of repetition and some stunted dialogue but, in the end, there is satisfaction for bringing a story to its conclusion. The guides are never about the story but about concluding the story. Then there's Final Fantasy IX and its guide. Unlike XIII I don't feel cheated by the game, but there was definitely one particularly bitter pill to swallow in Final Fantasy IX. You see, IX came out when marketing departments realized their might be something to this internet fad. Unsure how things worked and how people used it, someone thought it would be a great idea to put half of the strategy guide online. Squaresoft wanted users to sign up for their service, PlayOnline.Here's how I imagine the conversation went (I've entitled each decision-making person “Drone”, for maximum insult): Drone A: "Do you know what's Great?"Drone B: "What?"Drone A: "Getting people to sign up for our stupid service!"Drone B: "That is great!"Drone A: "Do you know what people buy for our strategy game?"Drone B: "What?"Drone A: "Strategy guides. Why don't we put half of our strategy guide on our online service? Then, when a user wants to find out a secret, or how to get an item, or unlock a piece of the game they have to do the following:First, go to their computer.Second, log in to their PlayOnline Account (the premier gaming service).Third, enter this code that we've placed in the guide specific to this puzzle piece. Finally, give them the answer."Drone B: "What if they want to see the secrets for the area or the region?"Drone A: "This is video games, people love entering codes for stuff."Drone B: "Done! Hookers and blow?"Drone A: "Hookers and blow."Final Fantasy IX has no specific tie to any life event of mine, I just wanted to put this in to remind Squaresoft: Fuck you for this, because IX was a fantastic game and you shat on my experience.## Christmas 2001My ears didn't pop when my plane descended. It was my first time home for winter break and my damn ears didn't pop. If you've ever known the nasty pain of not having your ears pop, it's like someone has filled your head full of helium and you are about to burst. The first quarter of school in college is usually the most exciting: You drink. You do drugs. You have sex. You sometimes go to class. Some people learn. Then your college roommate, DMO, asks you why you've been sleeping so much? You end up with mononucleosis and a 0.7 GPA.So here I am in San Diego on the first winter break sitting next to my Father with tears welling up because I am exhausted and in pain. I feel like a reverse asshole because I cant't swallow a damn thing.My swollen glands at their peak, I am whisked away to the doctor who promptly injects me with steroids. I return home and promptly fall asleep. Most of the holiday break is a blur, but not Final Fantasy X. Final Fantasy X was a special game. It was the first Final Fantasy released for the Playstation 2. It was the first time that Squaresoft had built an entirely 3D world (the previous games used pre-rendered backgrounds). It looked stunning, even through fog of illness. As a mono-inclined human being I have a very busy schedule. My day is as follows:- Sleep- Play Final Fantasy X- Maybe eat... maybe- Sleep more- Play Final Fantasy XI was in love with the game: The looming antagonist Sin, a large creature who could devastate cities. The cool demeanor of Auron. The complex world in which everyone dwelled. The fantastic battle system. It was helping me with this small yet annoying illness.In Final Fantasy X there were ultimate weapons. Ultimate weapons were the best weapons in the game and getting them meant nearly unbeatable characters. There was one particularly tricky weapon to get that involved hitting X every time lightning struck in a field 100 times. It is incredibly tough. I can't maintain the consistency needed.I got every other character's weapon, but not this one. I would try, then sleep, possibly eat, then try again. Nothing.Then, as fate would have it, Mike stops by to say hello...Thanks, Mike. It felt really great to have all those weapons.## Fin.I'm sitting here on my couch playing Final Fantasy XIII-2 now. I'm in another period of transition as cogs are moving that affect my future. I'm engaged to a wonderful person, I live in a great city and I have really fantastic friends and family. I am lucky. Things are in a good state, and I am happy.Final Fantasy is in a troubled state. No longer at the top of its game it is disliked and mocked by many as old-fashioned and unenjoyable. Audible groans emit from my friends when they ask what I'm playing and I respond.Yet, I'll still buy each new version because it means something to me.This is the magic of a great song, a touching movie, a book or a video game. It's not just the experience of these things but where you are in your life when you experience them. </section></article>
