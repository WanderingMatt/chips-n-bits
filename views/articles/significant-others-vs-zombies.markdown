My wife isn't a huge fan of video games. Actually, let me correct that. My wife isn't a huge fan of the current generation of video games. Up until recently, the last modern game she truly enjoyed was [Kya: Dark Lineage](http://glyde.com/#!viasearch/products/7948818/Kya-Dark-Lineage) for the PS2. Now, if I go all the back to NES or Genesis era, she has a long list of favorites. Unfortunately, I don't play those games anymore - I've played them enough and there is an endless stream of incoming games that I'd rather be playing. Also, have you played Super Mario lately? That game sucks. 

Our statistics were grim. After 8 years together, I'd only managed to find a single game that we had both enjoyed playing together. I never gave up hope though and the search finally paid off. I found something magical in the form of a very clever game company. My wife has fallen in love with [PopCap Games](http://www.popcap.com/)!

PopCap doesn't just make games that my wife absolutely adores. In the same way Pixar drops little pieces of grownup comedy gold in to films for children; PopCap sprinkles challenging logic and fantastic gameplay mechanisms into their games, just for me. I'm not entirely sure how they manage to slather so much mass appeal on top of their games without irritating me, but they do. And it works. First, Bejeweled, then Peggle. And now, [Plants vs Zombies](http://www.popcap.com/games/xbla/pvz)!

I love Plants vs Zombies. My wife loves Plants vs Zombies. It felt wrong at first, but fortunately PopCap has been around the block. The difficulty ramp made it easy for my wife to get comfortable. Flowers help too. She eventually let PvZ join the party and, after just a couple of weeks, she's hooked. With PvZ in the mix, there has been a venerable video game threesome going on at our place nearly every night this week. Hot.

It's not just about the sex appeal though. There is so much more to like about PvZ. How about 25 different types of zombies for starters. The concept is simple and addictive. The controls are intuitive. The art direction is fantastic. The comedy is cheeky. The gameplay is balanced, requires constant adaptation and makes for some truly tense moments. The difficulty ramps all the way up to impossible, for when you feel like torturing yourself. There are a bunch of different game modes. Yo, it even has unlockables, bro! Plants vs Zombies is arguably the best game for couples. Ever.

PopCap Games has done the impossible. They got on my radar by making solid games, then rocketed to the top by enamoring my wife. In short, they've made me a very happy man. Whatever they come out with next, will definitely be at the top of my watch list.
