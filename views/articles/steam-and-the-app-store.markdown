I'm a web developer by trade, so I use the Apple platform. There are lots of reasons for this and I'm not here to hate on Windows 7 (which I think is great) or worship the Ubuntu Voodoo (which I think is great). I'd like to talk about Mac gaming.

In particular, I'd like to talk about the fact that by the end of this year we'll have Civilization 5 on the Mac. 

Matthew, my leaf-worshipping counterpart, also uses a Mac and has held off on purchasing Civilization. He's waiting for the Mac version. I play on Windows 7 based off of Bootcamp. 

I get to enjoy it before he does.

My strategy these days, however, is very simple. I buy it on [Steam](http://steampowered.com). Not only am I thanking Valve for investing in a great platform, but I really love how Steam works. It's a great thing for PC and for Mac.

If you are a Mac user, and you're a devotee like myself, you know that Apple just announced the next version of their operating system, [Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/). One of Lion's features is that it has a built-in application store. 

One of the reason's behind the iPhone's success is gaming. Games are always the top selling apps and they do really well. It is my sincere hope that another platform like this will not only allow for competition, but also get more developers serious interested in the Mac platform.

I worry though, that handing the keys to the kingdom to a company that has never really respected the buying power of gamers, is trouble. 

Steam will always have one thing over the Mac App Store. You can use it on any platform. So, I'll always buy Steam.
